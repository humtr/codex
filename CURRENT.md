# Operating state and next work

Implementation: rewrite/rust-core. Publication: main's immutable source caller.
AGENTS.md owns development rules; SPEC.md owns product behavior and boundaries.
This repository carries no external workflow skill or model configuration.

## Operating baseline

Signed production authority is [rewrite/rust-core CURRENT.md](https://github.com/humtr/codex/blob/rewrite/rust-core/CURRENT.md).
The current device/public generation is stable50 (CLI0.161.0); older installed
processes retain their loaded images. This branch owns opt-in provider experiments,
not a parallel production activation pointer or release authority.

## ChatGPT internal transport and shared registration

The signed app's submit/cancel/state own a separate temporary conversation per
native thread, including guardian children; credentials stay inside the app.
Actual GPT-6 overlap/cancel-sibling proof passes. Two native Android clients pass
four commands, exact isolated markers/replies and shared-profile projection.
A guardian retry passes both clients and two actual reviews; its initial incomplete
sibling remains failed evidence. Full local checks,23 protocol/app tests and15
desktop/profile tests pass. Root stable50 fixes the sandbox regression; this pilot
now uses the same native baseline. Combined39-test model/global alias qualification
and signed/device activation are in progress. No Pro inference was performed.

## Independent window return and optional tmux

- `codex termux launch` selects an existing profile with Up/Down and Enter;
  Esc/Ctrl-C cancels, the saved default is unchanged, --profile is explicit and
  upstream bytes after -- are preserved. Default is tmux off. Ordinary interactive
  `codex` uses the same optional window routing without a profile picker.
- Native-capable Termux runs in the invoking terminal. Confirmed unsupported native
  API uses one random named dedicated terminal per launch without requiring tmux.
  Inconclusive AM failure never becomes a constructor fallback. Stock manual rename
  or close races may create an inert empty terminal, never restart/resume work.
- Bare foreground FD bindings and tmux pane bindings share notification focus.
  UUID changes use the live FD rather than labels/titles or stored conversations.
  `/switch`, /new, /resume and /title do not change the Android origin.
- Hidden/status requests inside tmux refuse before picker, launch descriptors,
  Android commands or work. Both Manager and AI removed their inside-session
  new-window branch; no nested session, extra pane or replacement workload is
  created. Independent Android terminals can each own a separate container.
  `codex termux attach SESSION` rebinds only detached Manager work without replay.
- tmux and Android starters use private single-consumption bounded descriptors for
  raw argv/caller environment; terminal identity stays new-terminal owned. The
  descriptors are removed before exec. Lazy cleanup requires verified departure.
  Temporary descriptors can contain caller auth environment; permanent bindings,
  Android intents, notifications and logs contain none of it.
- Native Termux extension on the existing authenticated AM socket captures exact
  handle/PID/start from peer ancestry and rechecks the app's live table on focus.
  It stops at the app boundary and introduces no new daemon/socket/registry.
  Installed package com.termux/code118, 0.118.0+8629e63.origin2, base8629e632.
  Existing APK acceptance/build38099833533 remains applicable; app inputs unchanged.
  APK SHA256d32973c555ff9d8d726306948a0e0af1c2b41ccd2938a22edcd848bf7a278453.
  Original and accepted APK remain in Download/termux-origin-candidate.
- User tapped all four fresh Manager return notifications. A/B bare and hidden tmux C with synthetic native workloads recorded exit0, selected=true and count5; D's seeded stock named
  route returned exit0/count5 on the custom APK. D proves named-service reuse,
  not an installation of an official APK. All four owned workloads exited normally;
  user-requested cleanup restored baseline count1 and removed the fake install trees.
  Private proof: ~/.cache/codex/acceptance/window-device-88b0a09.json. This return
  proof remains applicable to8ba5997: the follow-up only removes nested construction;
  fresh launch, binding and focus code is unchanged. Actual Android signed installed
  Manager also refused all three nested entrypoints before any state creation.
- A fresh notification is required for each trial: Android consumes it on one tap.
  Never ask for a second tap on an already consumed notification.
- The owned direct signed-stable46 title trial has no PTY intermediary or copied
  authentication. The user confirmed normal rendering and Termux title propagation;
  upstream persisted the selected activity/app-name/model/run-state/current-dir
  order. `/title` configures title fields/order, separately from route identity.
  A discarded intermediary trial rendered badly; it is not product acceptance.
- Bare same-PID frontend re-entry needs replacement of the old qualified FD
  binding. The affected real-exec path now passes native and named-route return,
  UUID changes and preservation of unknown bindings. Local composed full acceptance
  passed Core193/one pre-existing ignored, Manager42+55+three path gates, builder25,
  Python18+59, fmt/Clippy/diff. Two startup fixtures now clear inherited window-ready
  state, so a connected caller cannot silently bypass the first-launch advisory
  test. Hosted acceptance and signed stable47 installation passed. A fresh real frontend
  trial exposed a separate missing bare-registration call, which blocks its
  `/switch` notification-return acceptance until the frontend is replaced.

## Source and installed AI

- AI main e8d49c3 formally includes the installed profile/auth/Manager adapter and
  migration support; the approved normal push completed, with a clean source tree.
  Enhanced full verification passes50/warn0/fail0, including TUI166 and isolated
  installed Manager profile lifecycle. Migration stages complete accounts before
  publication, restores the source on failure and refuses unreadable live owners;
  unique AGY profile state is preserved. No real account migration was performed.
  All thirteen installed ai_* modules match the published source; only three
  modules needed atomic replacement, and seventeen other runtime/config hashes
  remained unchanged. Private proof: ~/.cache/codex/acceptance/ai-formal-source.json.
- App source remains the separate formal ~/prj/termux repository, with official Git
  history and read-only upstream. AI has no competing Codex profile/window authority.
- AI follow-up1f958e5 removes its AGY shim/installation path; enhanced full verification
  passes48/warn0/fail0. AGY main ac228cf publishes the formerly installed native Android
  support. Its full suite passed and the formal setup installed wrapper261011.01,
  upstream1.2.17, with one $PREFIX/bin/agy entrypoint. The raw input and all9302
  protected profile/authentication files retain their hashes; installed library and
  builder match published source. Native allocator/syscall patterns stay unchanged,
  while explicit Linux compatibility remains available. Default installation does
  not require glibc/proot. Private proof: agy-formal-source.json in the same cache.

## Reusable acceptance

- Exact source6c5819c acceptance38087812283 passed every job, including actual
  Android/AArch64 Core execution and locked workspace tests/Clippy/fmt.
  Local Core192 passed/one pre-existing ignored; Manager40 unit +55 integration
  +two public tmux/native-FD paths passed; release-builder25 and Python18+59 pass.
  Two superseded AI-action assertions were updated before the final Manager gate.
- Scoped d18f796 acceptance38100063268 covers documentation; runtime jobs skipped.
  Its unchanged6c runtime proof is reused rather than described as a fresh build.
- Repository-local development rules are accepted; main is a thin source caller.
  Standard checks are scripts/check.sh docs, python, rust or full, chosen by scope.

## Remaining limits

- The installed native frontend still gates FD registration on TMUX/TMUX_PANE,
  despite Manager supporting bare bindings. Existing synthetic native workload
  path proofs do not cover this real-frontend call. The maintained patch now removes
  that condition, and its native child gate exercises both bare and tmux processes.
  Native compilation/tests/lint, qualification binding, signing/publication and
  fresh physical return across `/switch` are pending; stable47 is not evidence that
  bare real-frontend notification return is complete. `/title` rendering itself
  remains accepted by the user.

- Broader authorized normalization continues separately: genuine official-APK
  fallback execution, independent AGY/OpenCode
  notification hooks, isolated real ChatGPT Web acceptance and the final home/usr
  authority audit. Existing synthetic browser proofs do not establish account,
  model, tool-loop, cancel, compact or resume acceptance. Photos v3 cleanup90b8546
  is published: retired snapshots remain recoverable in Git, active data/source
  bytes are preserved and clean-tree packaging/service-smoke passed.

- Public update currently fetches complete payloads with a300-second per-payload
  budget. Slow large downloads can hit that limit and trigger local-derived
  fallback; the existing same-version frontend rule can then refuse fallback.
  A verified inventory assembled from identical installed bytes and immutable
  Release assets is accepted by the ordinary `codex update --local` path. Efficient
  public acquisition reuse and clearer transport/fallback reporting remain separate
  Core work; do not change signing/admission to work around network speed.
- Existing old tmux work does not infer a detached original Android ancestor.
  New registered launch or explicit detached Manager attach supplies the origin;
  no notification creates replacement work to retrofit old jobs.
- Switching a live bare PTY into/out of tmux is not supported; choose a new safe
  launch. No user job was stopped to change execution mode.
