# Rust Core Workboard

This file owns only the active implementation or repository-maintenance bundle.
Accepted evidence and historical disposition belong in `GOAL.md`; normative
behavior belongs in `SPEC.md`.

## Current routing

- Repository: `humtr/codex`.
- Active branch: `rewrite/rust-core`.
- Original Rust Core goal status: **complete**.
- TERMUX-COMPAT TC-1, TC-2, and TC-3 are accepted and recorded in `GOAL.md`.
- TC-LIVE-BRIDGE source repair commit is
  `1b51902775c89c79522ef868921e4b95229a35fb` and has been pushed to
  `origin/rewrite/rust-core`.
- Selected upstream remains `rust-v0.154.0`, upstream commit
  `6b9826e3aa83b1a5947db50f4332cb9c65f1b340`.
- TC-LIVE-BRIDGE repository-native two-step live cutover is accepted and
  complete.
- Final live runtime is `codex-cli 0.154.0` with current generation
  `local-20260914-tc3-canonical-1` and retained previous generation
  `local-20260914-r10-browser-bridge-1`.
- Final live launcher SHA-256 is
  `0055ec0ecc762e4a4c878be62fd26f93118785218f004b26fe12b178cd3380eb`.
- UPDATE-CHANNEL-LATEST is accepted and closed. Final source acceptance before
  the closure ledger is `057f078a091441c1f624c7b229649bd1463ef774`.
- Public stable is signed sequence 10 generation
  `local-20260914-update-channel-bridge-1` at the verified GitHub Pages release
  base; retained R10 no-argument update and exact-current no-op are accepted.
- Active implementation bundle: **none**. New product or publication work requires
  a fresh bounded routing decision.
- `legacy/monolith` remains sealed at
  `bf30a7dc94d4dad7f58836c69028160856e63c58`.
- Worker mode remains OFF.

## Accepted TC-LIVE-BRIDGE disposition

The bounded repair retains existing v3/v4 trust and activation authority. Only
exact `creation_metadata = "r10-browser-helper-bridge-v1"` with the two accepted
browser helper identities in exact order may use signed `helpers/0` and
`helpers/1`. Normal generations use only `browser/open/curl` and
`browser/manual/curl`. Marker/layout mismatch fails closed. No release format,
key, bootstrap authority, package install, PATH authority, raw-runtime patch, or
direct launcher replacement was added.

Source acceptance and the decisive disposable migration/rollback proof are
recorded in `GOAL.md`. The final repository gate passed Core 141/0/1,
release-builder 15/15, Manager 20/20 plus 11/11, locked workspace check/test,
clippy `-D warnings`, formatting, and `git diff --check`.

Live preflight rebound the exact R10 baseline and final signed candidates. The
installed R10 updater then admitted signed bridge sequence 8; only after bridge
health and protected-state checks passed did the new Core admit canonical
sequence 9. Final doctor is healthy, resolver and protected auth/config/profile/
session identities are unchanged, canonical nested browser helpers are active,
and the bridge is retained as the one rollback generation. No live rollback was
performed solely for evidence.

## Accepted UPDATE-CHANNEL-LATEST disposition

Scope is deliberately bounded to the two defects exposed by the post-cutover
update smoke. Core may treat an authenticated candidate as already current only
when its release sequence equals the installed current sequence and both its
generation identity and signed release manifest exactly match current. Lower
sequences and equal-but-different releases remain fail-closed. No-op success must
not stage, probe, rewrite the launcher, or mutate activation state.

The stable channel repair publishes one new signed sequence-10 generation,
`local-20260914-update-channel-bridge-1`, with current repaired Core and exact
`creation_metadata = "r10-browser-helper-bridge-v1"`. Its signed helper inventory
remains `helpers/0` and `helpers/1` so the retained R10 sequence-7 parser can
consume the final public target directly. The selected upstream/runtime and TC1/
TC2/TC3 behavior remain 0.154.0-equivalent; this is a transport compatibility
layout, not a second updater or a rollback of canonical local policy.

GitHub Release assets remain staging for the large top-level files. A fixed
GitHub Pages workflow reconstructs the exact signed tree under
`https://humtr.github.io/codex/<generation_id>/` after binding the pinned public
key and verifying signature, bridge metadata, exact inventory, helper identities,
and every signed digest. The automated Core Release publisher remains fail-closed
for nested signed inventory. The workflow may be mirrored to `main`, but release
bytes never use the Contents API. Failed deployment/readback cannot advance the
signed index. Raw Git-tag publication, slash-bearing Release assets, and
companion-release routing are rejected qualification paths, not fallbacks.

Acceptance is complete. Focused anti-rollback/no-op regressions and the full
repository gate are green; the final gate is release-builder 15/15, Core
142/0/1, Manager 20/20 plus 11/11, locked workspace check/test, clippy
`-D warnings`, formatting, and `git diff --check`. Sequence 10 was built and
signed from the accepted 0.154.0 source, then staged as GitHub Release ID
388405334. Pages workflow run 34848065440 succeeded, and complete HTTPS readback
byte-matched the 292,960,783-byte signed tree. The final signed stable index at
`main` head `40692fd63b4b5408f4600b338e854225d8b653c5` targets sequence 10. A disposable retained R10
performed no-argument `codex update` directly from 0.153.4/sequence 7 to
0.154.0/sequence 10; a second no-argument update returned exit 0 with the exact
already-current message and no launcher/state/generation-tree mutation. The real
live sequence-9 canonical runtime remained healthy and unchanged at the measured
launcher, activation-state, resolver, and protected metadata boundaries. No live
runtime replacement, rollback, package-manager action, PATH/resolver change,
signing-key rotation, or credential/provider mutation occurred in this bundle.

## Resume rule

A fresh session resumes by reading `SPEC.md`, then `GOAL.md`, then this file and
verifying branch/HEAD plus the final live state before selecting any new work.
No further TERMUX-COMPAT implementation or live-migration bundle is implicitly
selected. Historical accepted evidence stays in `GOAL.md`.
