# Rust Core Workboard

This file owns only the active implementation bundle. Accepted evidence and
historical disposition belong in `GOAL.md`; normative behavior belongs in
`SPEC.md`.

## Current routing

- Repository: `humtr/codex`.
- Active branch: `rewrite/rust-core`.
- Bound B11 implementation tip: `c61f712cac0d3822a5ca66e48115215ff2722c07`.
- B11 legacy-handoff contract is implemented and acceptance evidence is closed
  in `GOAL.md`; no product mutation remains pending in this workboard.
- Remote `origin/rewrite/rust-core` remains at
  `253156c37a2bd22af8faae0bce03587999ffd136`; the local branch is ahead and
  no push is authorized.
- Current milestone: M2 delivery/recovery is active; M2-B10 and M2-B11 are
  accepted acceptance candidates, with independent product review next.
- The inherited pre-commit hook references absent
  `tools/update-wrapper-version.sh`; do not modify it. If it alone rejects an
  exact, revalidated staged tree, use the established `--no-verify` closure.
- `legacy/monolith` remains sealed at
  `bf30a7dc94d4dad7f58836c69028160856e63c58`.
- `main` remains publication authority. No merge, promotion, push, or live
  cutover is authorized by this bundle.
- Worker mode is OFF. The primary Lead owns implementation, validation,
  authority updates, commit, and acceptance.

## Product-speed policy

- The accepted B11 path is qualification-first. Its concrete legacy gap was the
  absence of an explicit safe handoff from a non-v3 entrypoint to the accepted
  Core; the implementation is limited to the exact bootstrap boundary in
  `SPEC.md`.
- Use a release-built, locked Core and signed local artifacts as the only
  product input. Build outputs stay in private temporary roots; no generated
  artifact is committed.
- The bwrap resolution is an explicit product boundary: Core does not invoke
  or repair bwrap on Termux. Ordinary launch uses the accepted no-sandbox
  policy; explicit unsupported Linux sandbox requests fail closed with a clear
  error; the official input archive may contain bwrap, but final generation
  selection consumes and discards that resource.
- Fresh-Termux and legacy-upgrade checks must target separate disposable
  environments. The current installed launcher, resolver, Manager state,
  auth/profile/session data, and package state are protected.
- Do not copy legacy implementation or internal data models into the rewrite.
  Inspect legacy behavior only through observable qualification outcomes.
- Do not introduce another fallback, promotion wrapper, trust source, or
  compatibility layer without first updating `SPEC.md` and mapping a focused
  regression.

## Mandatory execution gates

1. Rebind branch, HEAD, dirty state, authority revisions, and protected live
   identities before every resume.
2. Use the canonical project registry and revision-3 private project root for
   all disposable qualification environments.
3. Keep each slice vertical: production change if any, focused regression,
   nonzero focused invocation, relevant compile/test success, and diff review.
4. Stop on compilation failure, zero tests, stale expectations, unexpected
   warnings/dead paths, or missing proof mapping.
5. B11's grouped acceptance, release/formatting checks, protected-surface
   verification, authority update, and implementation commit are complete.
6. Reserve independent product review for this completed Milestone 2
   acceptance candidate.

## Next action

### M2 independent product review candidate

M2-B11 is closed at product tip c61f712cac0d3822a5ca66e48115215ff2722c07;
accepted evidence and KEEP/COLLAPSE/DELETE disposition are recorded in GOAL.md.

- Review SPEC.md, GOAL.md, and the committed B11 product path as one acceptance candidate.
- Keep the review read-only; record findings before any additional product mutation.
- Do not promote to main, push, replace the live launcher, mutate the live resolver,
  or invoke bounded device qualification without explicit authorization.
- Worker mode remains OFF; the primary Lead owns the review handoff and any
  follow-up bounded bundle.
