# Codex for Termux

This repository is the clean rewrite of the Termux compatibility layer for the
upstream Codex CLI.

The rewrite has one public command, `codex`, and two internal layers:

- a minimal native Rust Core that makes the upstream runtime work correctly on
  Termux and owns installation, update, diagnosis, activation, and rollback;
- a separate Manager layer reached through `codex termux` for execution
  profiles and notifications. Conversation
  discovery and resume remain upstream-owned.

## Current status

See `CURRENT.md` for the accepted source, signed public
release and installed generation. The Rust Core owns signed installation,
update, diagnosis, atomic activation, rollback, and recovery; Manager remains
optional behind `codex termux`.

`codex termux help` lists the installed Manager commands. Profiles separate
execution preferences and authentication while sharing upstream conversation
storage. `notify show/set` controls Termux notification/toast delivery;
`notify test` sends fixed test text and reports each selected provider's result.
Notification taps foreground Termux. With `notify set --focus tmux` and AI tmux
launch, a qualified live conversation selects one named Android terminal attached
to its existing tmux session, creating it only if absent. Repeated taps reuse it;
closing it permits one replacement. No new Codex workload or `resume` is started.
The `UserInputRequest` notification selector covers structured questions and
follow-up input requests. Diagnosis and recovery remain available through Core
`codex doctor`, `codex update`, and `codex update --rollback`.
Exact contracts belong to `SPEC.md`.

Profiles support creation, deletion, renaming and a saved default. All lifecycle commands are available in the installed Manager:

```sh
codex termux profile create work
codex termux profile rename work personal
codex termux profile default personal
codex termux profile default default
codex termux profile delete personal
```

`profile default` without an ID shows the saved choice. It affects later ordinary
launches; an explicit `CODEX_HOME` takes priority. Deletion removes that account's
login and settings while preserving shared conversations. Rename/delete reject
an account still in use or selected as the saved default; choose another default
and close its running clients/servers first.

## Fresh install

A fresh Termux environment needs the existing Termux shell, curl, and OpenSSL.
No Rust compiler, package-manager install, release private key, or GitHub account
is required on the device.

The accepted public entrypoint is the immutable online installer:

```sh
"$PREFIX/bin/curl" -q --fail --silent --show-error --location --proto '=https' --proto-redir '=https' --tlsv1.2 --connect-timeout 15 --max-time 60 --max-filesize 131072 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/humtr/codex/9972a3288c0531ba744e9bd1356273d9a080aa79/install-online.sh' | "$PREFIX/bin/sh"
```

The network frontend is only acquisition. It pins the accepted bootstrap public
key, verifies the signed stable index and release manifest before using their
network-selected values, downloads the bounded signed inventory, and delegates
all persistent writes to the existing local
`install.sh -> bootstrap/codex-bootstrap -> Core` path.

For an already downloaded signed bundle, `install.sh` remains the local/offline
frontend defined by `SPEC.md`.

## Updating

After installation, ordinary updates remain Core-owned:

```sh
codex update
```

The default route consumes the signed stable channel. It does not delegate to
the upstream self-updater, and publication credentials are not device update
authority.

## Active work across accounts

When upstream resume reports an active writer in another account, run:

```sh
codex termux task
```

The helper shows current writer-lock holders and their execution accounts, then
offers reconnect, confirmed stop, or stop and resume in the current account. A UUID can restrict
selection: `codex termux task <THREAD_UUID>`. History browsing remains upstream
`codex resume`.
Ownership follows the current kernel lock holder; an original author or a
read-only window left open by a previous account is not treated as the owner.

For explicit actions, use `task status [THREAD_UUID]`, `task reconnect THREAD_UUID`,
`task stop THREAD_UUID`, or `task takeover THREAD_UUID --profile PROFILE_ID`
after `codex termux`. Omitting `--profile` uses the fresh-launch account: explicit
`CODEX_HOME`, then the saved default, then the native default.
A completed cancellation can still leave a writer held by another connected
window. Reconnect or close that connection before ordinary takeover.

Force takeover stops the entire owning server, potentially including other
work. The interactive helper shows that scope and requires confirmation; the
explicit form uses the exact displayed `--force-server PID:START` token. It
never deletes the writer lock. Manager is optional; ordinary Codex remains usable
without this helper. See SPEC for authoritative scope and failure behavior.

## Documents

- `SPEC.md` — normative product and architecture contract
- `CURRENT.md` — operating baseline, proof and remaining work
- `AGENTS.md` — repository-local execution and safety rules

## Branches

- `main` — publication authority; not the implementation base
- `rewrite/rust-core` — independent orphan Rust Core implementation lineage
- `legacy/monolith` — sealed predecessor at `bf30a7d`

The implementation branch remains independent from the publication branch.
Current stable-channel promotion changes only the signed public index authority
on `main` through the accepted non-forced CAS release path; implementation
development continues on `rewrite/rust-core`.

Published browser-bridge releases before the Manager TUI may reject a direct
update with “R10 browser helper bridge contract is invalid.” Run this one-time
migration from the immutable signed Release, then ordinary updates. The existing
Core verifies its trusted signature and complete inventory; profiles, conversations
and running clients are preserved. The temporary download is always cleaned.

```sh
(
  set -eu
  migration="$(mktemp -d "${TMPDIR:?}/codex-migration.XXXXXX")"
  trap 'rm -rf -- "$migration"' EXIT
  gh release download local-hosted-0-161-0-ab644771ac89-manager-tui-bridge \
    --repo humtr/codex --dir "$migration" \
    --pattern core --pattern generation.meta --pattern manager --pattern runtime \
    --pattern codex-code-mode-host --pattern helper-0 --pattern helper-1 \
    --pattern release.manifest --pattern release.sig
  chmod 0644 "$migration/generation.meta" "$migration/release.manifest" "$migration/release.sig"
  mkdir "$migration/helpers"
  mv "$migration/helper-0" "$migration/helpers/0"
  mv "$migration/helper-1" "$migration/helpers/1"
  chmod 0755 "$migration/core" "$migration/manager" "$migration/runtime" \
    "$migration/codex-code-mode-host" "$migration/helpers/0" "$migration/helpers/1"
  codex update --local "$migration"
  codex update
)
```

## Development

The repository owns its development rules in `AGENTS.md`, optimized for
GPT-6.1 Sol. Use concise context, direct implementation and calibrated reasoning.
`scripts/check.sh docs`, `python`, `rust`, or `full` selects the relevant gate.
Compiler output lives in the XDG cache; test data is disposable.
Runtime/security/installer changes and release candidates require full acceptance.

Implementation and reusable release logic live on `rewrite/rust-core`. The small
`main` caller pins accepted workflow and source to one immutable commit. Scheduled
publication admits qualified newer backends; manual `rebuild_current` rebuilds
the qualified current version. Manual `publish` defaults to false: unsigned
build/smoke only, without signing, Release, Pages or stable mutation.
